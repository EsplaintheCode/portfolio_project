# WNBA Project

# Description

The information reflects the following statistics: 3 point %, free throw % and field goal percent % for each player and
for each team.

 The package includes the following files:
1. seed.py which will seed the database WBA with real-time information for all players and team in the WNBA league. 

2. models.py has the model structure for the database 

3. team.py has the API information for only the Team Model.

# Retrospective Questions
1. The project design evolved over time by having the data pull real-time. I wanted to be able to have the ability
to use the data for real time analysis. Additionally, I wanted to create an API for both players and teams but 
only finished the teams.
2. ORM was chosen since the class heavily emphasized it through the workshops and exercises.
3. Future improvements the following:
- Building out the player API
- Reconfigure the primary keys and add unique constraints
- Create data visualizers to do comparisons
- Create an API that pulls all player stats from a Team API call
